UTA Bootcamp homework 2: make a portfolio website from scratch

HTML
I used starter code from the previous homework as that was a responsive layout and included links within the webpage

CSS
I copied and used one of the reset.css files from Unit 2

I used information to style my images from https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_rwd_images.asp
