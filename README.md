# Homework-2-Portfolio
UTA Bootcamp homework 2: Make a portfolio website from scratch.

My portfolio page contains a header with links to various sections on my page with an About Me section, work samples, and contact information. The work samples will have content added later.

HTML
I used some HTML starter code from Homework 1, as that was a responsive layout and included links that navigate within the webpage.

CSS
I copied and used one of the reset.css files from Unit 2.

I used information to style my images from https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_rwd_images.asp

I was assisted by my tutor to divide up my HTML more cleanly and better understand flexbox and responsive design in my CSS.
