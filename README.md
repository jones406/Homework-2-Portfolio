# Portfolio
This Portfolio was made when I began learning HTML and CSS. I've periodically updated it throughout my time at the University of Texas Coding Bootcamp. I will eventually archive this after I've completed my React.js portfolio.

## Tools
I used Google Fonts, Materialize CSS, and Font Awesome Icons to complete this project.
